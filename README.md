# Jaywalking

## Introduction
A game created using [React](https://reactjs.org) where the objective is to get to the other end of the board without getting run over by a truck and without drowning in the river.

React [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) are used to implement the essential functionality required for the game, custom hooks are also created to implement the game's rules. The [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org) library is used for state management throughout the game.
